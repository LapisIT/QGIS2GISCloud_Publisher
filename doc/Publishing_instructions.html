<h1>GIS Cloud uploader for QGIS</h1>
<p>This tool permits the upload of vector and raster datasets into a GIS Cloud 
account using an account API key. Layers can be produced and manipulated locally 
in a QGIS workspace and reproduced directly into the file manager of the selected GIS Cloud
account. 
</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>

<p>Uploadable file types are limited to the extensions accepted by GIS Cloud:</p> 
<p><b>Vector:</b> .shp, .mif, .mid, .tab, .kml, .gpx, .tif, .tiff, .json, .geojson</p>
<p><b>Raster:</b> .sid .tif, .tiff, .ecw, .img, .jp2, .jpg, .gif, .png, .pdf</p>
<p>*upload of one or more in any combination of file formats is permitted.  
The size of the upload is restricted by the storage space available in the GIS Cloud account.</p>

<h3>API Key</h3>

<p>This tool requires the user to enter a GIS Cloud API Key as an input parameter. 
In order to generate an API Key log into your GIS Cloud account, click in the top 
right hand corner drop down menu Hi*Your Name*>>My Account. In the pop up box navigate to the far 
right tab API Access>> Add Key. This will produce a new API key, copy this key and keep it safe.</p>

<p>To enter it into QGIS click on the tab Processing>>Options. Expand Providers>>
GISCloud Uploader. Ensure the activate box is ticked, double click on the space below and 
paste in the GIS Cloud API Key. You will only need to do this once.</p>

<h3>Vector Layers</h3>

<p>Click on the button with the three dots to produce a pop out menu from which 
to choose the vector layers you wish to upload. This will allow you to select any or all of the 
vector layers which are in your current project Layers Panel (limited to the size of 
your GIS Cloud storage limit). The name of the layer will be transferred directly to the 
upload folder.</p>

<h3>Raster Layers</h3>

<p>Click on the button with the three dots to produce a pop out menu from which 
to choose the raster layers you wish to upload. This will allow you to select any or all of the 
raster layers which are in your current project Layers Panel (limited to the size of 
your GIS Cloud storage limit). The name of the layer will be transferred directly to the 
upload folder.</p>

<h3>GIS Cloud folder name</h3>

<p>Enter a name for the folder the layers will be uploaded into. If a name isn't entered the
 default name will be QGIS upload - if this folder already exists or if the name entered is
 the same as one which exists the new layers will be appended into that folder.</p>

<h3>Check-box for optional map creation</h3>

<p>If you would like to create a new map project in which to enter the uploaded layers
check this tick box.</p>
	
<h3>GIS Cloud project map name</h3>

<p>This will be the name for the new map/project in which the layers will be uploaded.</p>
	
<h3>Upload map extent</h3>

<p>Provide the map extent for the layers you are uploading.</p>

<h3>Processing output</h3>

<p>To review the output messages from the process click on the speech bubble in the bottom 
right of the QGIS window and navigate to the tab 'Processing'. This will provide a description of the success 
or failure of folder and map creation as well as file types uploaded.</p>
