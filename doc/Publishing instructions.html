<h1>Displacement lines</h1>
<p>This tool build lines based on the original base points dataset and the
    output displaced points. This is more for testing, but can be used as an
    easy visualisation of how far points have moved.</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>

<h3>Base layer</h3>

<p>The base point dataset. Note that not all the points in this dataset are
    required to be in the output so you can use the base dataset to link to
    displaced points which were the subset of the input.</p>

<h3>Base layer ID field</h3>

<p>The ID field from the base layer that is used to link to the displaced
    points.</p>

<h3>Displaced layer</h3>

<p>The layer of displaced points generated from the input layer. All points in
this layer should also be present in the base layer. If they are not IDs will be
written as warnings in the log.</p>

<h3>Displaced layer ID field</h3>

<p>The ID field from the displaced points to link to the original base dataset.
    Allowing for different ID fields gives the tool a bit more utility, and
    allows for you to make updates to the displaced points layer.</p>

<h2>Output parameters</h2>

<h3>Displacement lines</h3>

<p>A polyline dataset with points built from the points in the base layer to the
    corresponding points in the output layer. The points are attributed with the
    ID of the shared points.</p>
